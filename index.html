       <p>
        <span>Hello.</span>I am <strong><mark>Gexuan</mark></strong> from China, maybe you can tell it from my name. I
        have been in Ottawa for one week. I am on my quarantine now. I had my second-time <mark><em>covid-19</em></mark>
        <sub>test</sub> the day before yesterday. The result comes out to be <i>not detected</i>, which is a relief to
        me. I am now pretty homesick and missing my family and my dogs.
       </p>
        <hr>
        <P>I pray for the world to be safe and thriving again. This year is a challenging year for people from all over
        the world. <del>We are anxious in the shadow of the virus.</del> But we still have to unite to fight the virus.
        A couple of months ago, I read a book named <strong><abbr title="A New York Times Bestseller"
        >《The choice: Embrace the possible》</abbr></strong>which written by
        <abbr title="doctor"><sup>Dr.</sup></abbr><strong>Edith Eva Egar</strong>. She is
        my mentor in my darkest hour. Her extraordinary life shines like a star in my mind.
        </p>
